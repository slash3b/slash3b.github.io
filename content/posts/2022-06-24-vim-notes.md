These are my notes on "Mastering VIM" by Ruslan Osipov.
Also contains my own knowledge.   

`dd` — delete line  
`cc` — delete line and go into INSERT mode  

### Movements
> uppercase is for "words separated by whitespace"     

`e` or `E` — move to the End of the word      
`w` or `W` — move between Words      
`b` or `B` — move Back        
`_` jump to the beginning of the line   
`:N` where N is a number line. Will move you to that line number   
`gi` places you in INSERT mode you were last time
`zz` move current line the the center
`s` delete single character and enter INSERT mode   

### Buffers
`:ls` list buffers     
`:bn` and `:bp` next and previous buffer      
`:bd` delete buffer     

> "vim-unimpaired" makes some navigation and motions much easier

`de` delete from cursor position till the end of the word   

### Splits
`:sp` horizontal split   
`:vs` vertical split   

### Windows
`Ctrl+w` -> `q` close current window   
`Ctrl+w` -> `j`, `k`, `l` or `h` move between windows      
`Ctrl+w` -> `J`, `K`, `L` or `H` move w:indows   

`:wqa` write and quit all windows    
`Ctrl+w` -> `o` close all window except current one      
`Ctrl+w` -> `R` flip windows placement   

### Tabs   
`:tabnew` create new tab   
`gt` or `gT` to navigate between tabs

> you can load your vim config with `:source $MYVIMRC` 

### Text objects   
delete inside smth., e.g. `di(` delete everyting inside matching braces `(`  

> `:help text-objects` 

### Registers 
##### powerful multi-bucket storage for stuff you copy paste   
`:reg` view list of registers  
call register with `"`  

interact with register "a" with `"a`   
e.g. yank word to "a" register with `"ayw`   

`Ctrl+r` -> `<name of registry>` paste from register in INSERT mode, e.g. paste from "a" registry with `Ctrl+r` -> `a`   

`gd` navigate to definition  
`gD` will look for definition from the beginning of the file  

### Diff  
##### as in vim diff tool 
`:do` move change to active window   
`:dp` push change from active window   
`c[` next change   
`c]` prev change   

### Quickfix list     
##### usually gets filled in by results from make, or vimgrep and etc.
`:copen` open quickfix list  
`:cclose` or `:bd` close list   
`:cnext` next item in a list   
`:cprev` previous item in a list   

### Replacements  

`:s/repl/subj/flags` replace "repl" on __the line__   
`:%s/repl/subj/flags` do the relpacement but for the __whole__ file 

### Macros   
##### a way to replay annoying bits you have to do right now   

- enter macro mode by hitting `q` and followed by any register, e.g. "a", as in `qa`  
- do your actions in a repeatable way   
- finish your macro by hitting `q`  

Play macro with `@` followed by registry name. For example if you saved macro in "a" registry, 
then you can replay it with `@a`  

In order to replay last used macro, hit `@@`  

> when macro hits bottom of a file, it starts again from the top of the file. To forbid that use `set nowrapscan` in
> your config file   

> macros are stored in registers, you can view created/saved macro with `:reg`  
   
### Misc  
`:terminal` or `:term` turns on terminal mode
