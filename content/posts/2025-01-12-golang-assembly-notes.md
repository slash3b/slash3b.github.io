**Note #1**: If you do not know assembly, here is a well written introduction to assembly: https://github.com/hackclub/some-assembly-required

**Note #2**: Trying to compile and disassembly code of the whole project makes no sense. Use small snippets of code. Seems to be obvious, eh?

**Note #3**: Go uses pseudo assembly. From that assembly go can build/link/compile for any architecture.

**Note #4**: Use `go tool compile` to compile package code to the object file. Use `go tool objdump` to see what gets into the binary. Do not forget that you can always view documentation for these commands with `go doc cmd/compile` or `go doc cmd/objdump`.

**Note #5**: In 1.17 calling convention has changed from stack based to registers based. Calling convention is a part of Application Binary Interface.
