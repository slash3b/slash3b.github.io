How it went: 
- I did manage to escape sucky job at Pentalog. What a relief! My wife Tatiana was looking through local job ad board
  and found an ad for Go. I managed to land it, yay! It is an interesting project and I like it. Teams seems to be
  strong and much saner. There is a lot of stuff to do. And I'm writing Golang which is amazing! It is a little dream
  that came true. The sad part is that I'm under heavy stress — I'm being told I'm under achieving and not putting out
  all I have. And I'm trying my best. Anyway it is still much better then my previous job. 
  Also forgot to mention, current project is a distributed system! This is some much harded that a CRUD I used to work
  on. 
- daily plan is in action, but I'm moving veeeeery slowly. A solution is to chose less targets to work simultaneously.   
- read some awesome books 
- did not do much with my math : (
- became better at testing software. I have never wrote that many tests being a PHP dev. 
- was active at hacker rank and now I have 5 stars at Problem solving. Not much to brag about, it is a long road to go. 
- made a trello board that helps me to track multiple goals and see everything on a board 
- was not doing much for open-source 
- read two books on distributes systems by Sam Newman and Martin Kleppman
- due to covid pirata.md died since patria.md was not updated for a long time and right now it is not even online 



Personal accomplishments:
- before corona hit hard I was trying to find a relocation job and failed miserably
- I'm going to be a father ^^ soooo happy about this : ) 
- we bought an appartment, which is a relief but I'm also have to pay mortgage : (


Plan for the next year:
- be more active with open-source PHP and Golang — hard but sure way to grow! 
- become a father 
- math
- algo problems 
- have to improve Go further and solidify concurrency 
- learn multithreading programming, multithreading models
- became a valuable member of my current team. I do not want to give up on this, I feel like there is so much to learn
  on this position. 
- pick up new language. Have not decided yet. As of now I'm somewhat capable with PHP, Go and Python. New language
  should be different from those above. Maybe Rust? C? Scheme? Lisp? Clojure? 
- new pet project!
