Passing a slice between functions is okay, since it is copied BUT in the copied version we still have the correct pointer.</p>

Decision should be based on a nature of a given type. e.g. time is always a copy, you can&rsquo;t really change time. A File
can be changed so it should be passed as a reference. See how it is implemented in core library.</p>
