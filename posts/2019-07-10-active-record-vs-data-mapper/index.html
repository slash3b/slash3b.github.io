Active record According to Martin Fowler Active Directory is:\n An object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapsulates the database access, and adds domain logic on that data. Object carries both data and behavior.\n My interpretaion in plain english:\n Active Record implies that an entity represents a table from database and each instance of an entity represents one row from the table, also that entity contains not only data but also all methods/operations to deal with that data. So it typically contains CRUD methods like save(), delete(), update(), find() and etc.\n Examples of AR:\n Ruby on Rails Laravel’s Eloquent Propel (Symfony) Yii Active Record Django’s ORM  Older version of Doctrine ORM did follow Active Record pattern and an entity was created and saved this way:\nname = \"john\"; $user-password = \"doe\"; $user-save(); echo \"The user with id $user-id has been saved.\"; In Ruby on Rails it could be like this:\nu = User.create(name: \"john\", password: \"doe\") Here is another exaple using Eloquent ORM:\nDefine entity like so:\nclass User extends Model {} and that is basically it. You can fire User::all() in order to get all users.\nThe entity does not have fields mapping becase they are alredy defined in the database.\nSo the major benefits of AR are:\n simplicity easy to start with  Disadvantages are:\n strong binding between database and application - entities contain domain behaviour apart from the data itself can become messy in big projects  Data Mapper From wikipedia:\n A Data Mapper is a Data Access Layer that performs bidirectional transfer of data between a persistent data store (often a relational database) and an in-memory data representation (the domain layer). The goal of the pattern is to keep the in-memory representation and the persistent data store independent of each other and the data mapper itself.\n That is a long definition and it definitely says something but I need a bit more succint and clear definition, otherwise my brain wont remember it. So I like this by Martin Fowler:\n The Data Mapper is a layer of software that separates the in-memory objects from the database. Its responsibility is to transfer data between the two and also to isolate them from each other.\n For instance here an example of Doctine2 Entity:\nid; } // ... getter and setter methods } Note how it lacks CRUD and domain methods, also mapping definition is done via annotaions.\nExamples of Data Mapper:\n Java Hibernate Doctrine2 SQLAlchemy in Python EntityFramework for Microsoft .NET Golang Prisma Ecto Elixir  PHP example with Doctrine2.

<p>ORM implies existence of DBAL(Database Abstraction Layer) and Data Access Layer.</p>
<ul>
<li>DBAL abstracts Quering language details of different databases and supports many databases at once. Theoretically you can switch seamlessly from one database to another, though I never heard of practical execution of this feature.</li>

<h1 id=active-record>Active record<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#active-record>#</a></h1>
<p>According to <a href=https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html>Martin Fowler</a> Active Directory is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapsulates the database
access, and adds domain logic on that data. Object carries both data and behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My interpretaion in plain english:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Active Record implies that an entity represents a table from database and each
instance of an entity represents one row from the table, also that entity contains
not only data <strong>but</strong> also all methods/operations to deal with that data. So it
typically contains CRUD methods like <code>save()</code>, <code>delete()</code>, <code>update()</code>, <code>find()</code> and etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples of AR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Laravel’s Eloquent</li>
<li>Propel (Symfony)</li>
<li>Yii Active Record</li>
<li>Django’s ORM</li>
</ul>
<p>Older version of Doctrine ORM did follow Active Record pattern and an entity was created and saved this way:</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>&lt;?php
$user = new User();
$user-&gt;name = &quot;john&quot;;
$user-&gt;password = &quot;doe&quot;;
$user-&gt;save();
echo &quot;The user with id $user-&gt;id has been saved.&quot;;

</code></pre><p>In Ruby on Rails it could be like this:</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>u = User.create(name: &quot;john&quot;, password: &quot;doe&quot;)
</code></pre><p>Here is another exaple using <a href=https://laravel.com/docs/5.0/eloquent>Eloquent ORM</a>:</p>
<p>Define entity like so:</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>class User extends Model {}
</code></pre><p>and that is basically it. You can fire <code>User::all()</code> in order to get all users.<br>
The entity does not have fields mapping becase they <em>are</em> alredy defined in the database.</p>
<p>So the major benefits of AR are:</p>
<ul>
<li>simplicity</li>
<li>easy to start with</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>strong binding between database and application - entities contain domain behaviour apart from the data itself</li>
<li>can become messy in big projects</li>
</ul>
<h1 id=data-mapper>Data Mapper<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#data-mapper>#</a></h1>
<p>From wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Data Mapper is a Data Access Layer that performs bidirectional transfer of data between a persistent data store (often a relational database) and an in-memory data representation (the domain layer). The goal of the pattern is to keep the in-memory representation and the persistent data store independent of each other and the data mapper itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a long definition and it definitely says something but I need a bit more succint and clear definition, otherwise my brain wont remember it. So I like this by Martin Fowler:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Data Mapper is a layer of software that separates the in-memory objects from the database. Its responsibility is to transfer data between the two and also to isolate them from each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For instance here an example of Doctine2 Entity:</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>&lt;?php
// src/Entity/Product.php
namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity(repositoryClass=&quot;App\Repository\ProductRepository&quot;)
 */
class Product
{
    /**
     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\GeneratedValue
     * @ORM\Column(type=&quot;integer&quot;)
     */
    private $id;

    /**
     * @ORM\Column(type=&quot;string&quot;, length=255)
     */
    private $name;

    /**
     * @ORM\Column(type=&quot;integer&quot;)
     */
    private $price;

    public function getId()
    {
        return $this-&gt;id;
    }

    // ... getter and setter methods
}
</code></pre><p>Note how it lacks CRUD and domain methods, also mapping definition is done via annotaions.</p>
<p>Examples of Data Mapper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java Hibernate</li>
<li>Doctrine2</li>
<li>SQLAlchemy in Python</li>
<li>EntityFramework for Microsoft .NET</li>
<li>Golang Prisma</li>
<li>Ecto Elixir</li>
</ul>
<p>PHP example with Doctrine2. See, how CRUD et all operations are done with EntityManager and not with Entity itself?</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>
$user = new User();
$user-&gt;setName(&quot;john&quot;);
$user-&gt;setPassword(&quot;doe&quot;);
$entityManager-&gt;persist($user);
$entityManager-&gt;flush();
echo &quot;The user with id &quot; . $user-&gt;getId() . &quot;has been saved.&quot;;

</code></pre><p>Benefits of Data Mapper:</p>
<ul>
<li>clear separation of domain logic and database</li>
<li>a lot of flexibility. That is arguable of course, because with enough experience AR allows a lot of flexibility too, imo</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have to learn how to work with it</li>
<li>may not be easy to set up and start with</li>
</ul>
