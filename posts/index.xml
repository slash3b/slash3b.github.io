How to model services. What makes a good service:
loose coupling high cohesion Loose coupling means a change to one service should not require a change in another service. Tight coupling might means &amp;ldquo;chatty&amp;rdquo; communication, or wrong integration style was chosen that binds services tightly.
High cohesion — we want related behavior to be in the same service, and unrelated behavior to live in another service.
Bounded context helps with those two aspects of a good service.</description></item><item><title>A philosophy of software design by John Ousterhout</title><link>https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2020-09-05-a-philosophy-of-software-design/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2020-09-05-a-philosophy-of-software-design/</guid><description>I like that book and decided to make a &amp;ldquo;short&amp;rdquo; version for myself to remember it better.

Singly-linked list consits of nodes that reference one another. A node could look like this:
class Node: def __init__(self, value=None): self.next = None self.value = value So it has two properties — next that contains next element, and value that contains data.

Variance is a property of class hierarchies describing how the types of a type constructor affect subtypes. Type constructor is a thingy that builds new types from the old ones.
In general, a type constructor can be:

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability
It was first coined by Andreas Reuter and Theo Härder in 1983 in attempt to describe all that is necessary for the database to be fault-tolerant as much as possible.
Atomicity Database should support transaction, namely you should be able to group you request statemets and execute them at once.</description></item><item><title>Milestone notes</title><link>https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2020-01-04-milestone-notes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2020-01-04-milestone-notes/</guid><description>For this new year I plan to:

One of the most important and yet simple REST consept is resouce/endpoint, I really like resource term so I&amp;rsquo;m going to use it here. In REST paradigm URL is a resource, e.g. — http://example.org/test/foo.
You should strive not to use verbs in URL. The only verbs you need are HTTP verbs — GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE.

ORM implies existence of DBAL(Database Abstraction Layer) and Data Access Layer.

So inheritance is awesome way to reuse code between objects but it comes at cost.
When class inherit from parent class there is no way to not implement methods/reduce parent&amp;rsquo;s code. You have to implement everything according to parent class You need to make sure you are compatible with parent&amp;rsquo;s class in case override something Child class may know about parent&amp;rsquo;s methods implementation, in case they are not private, which breaks incapsulation Inheritance means deep coupling between parent and child classes Composition is just another way to inherit other classes Basically you do not inherit class directly but get it injected into the constructor or via setter method.</description></item><item><title>HTTP versions difference</title><link>https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2019-03-15-http-versions-difference/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2019-03-15-http-versions-difference/</guid><description>Here is the differences between HTTP versions with comments in plain english.
HTTP 1.0 capabilities: Request may consist of multiple newline separated header fields.
Response object is prefixed with a response status line.
Response object has its own set of newline separated header fields.
Response object is not limited to hypertext.
So basically since this version it is not hypertext but hypermedia protocol.

Here is an example:
interface Visitor { // quite reasonable to a visitor to be able to &amp;#34;visit&amp;#34; other classes public function visit(Person $person); } interface Person { public function accept(Visitor $visitor); } // so these two interfaces know about each other class RealVisitor implements Visitor { public function visit(Person $person) { // this sequence of &amp;#34;operations&amp;#34; is quite naive // but you can implement here whatever you want // instance of Person interface can be changed however you want // no need to update/change class itself $person-&amp;gt;name = &amp;#39;Mr.</description></item><item><title>tcpdump tiny cheat sheet</title><link>https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2018-11-10-tcpdump-how-to/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2018-11-10-tcpdump-how-to/</guid><description>tcpdump is such an amazing tool, even knowing just basic parameters you can do a lot.
