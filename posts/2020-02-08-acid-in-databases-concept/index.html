ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability
It was first coined by Andreas Reuter and Theo Härder in 1983 in attempt to describe all that is necessary for the database to be fault-tolerant as much as possible.


Atomicity 
Database should support transaction, namely you should be able to group you request statemets and execute them at once. The very important feature here is abortability — ability to rollback any changes done in case we have an error in transaction somewhere along the way."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2020-02-08-acid-in-databases-concept/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://slash3b.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://slash3b.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://slash3b.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://slash3b.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://slash3b.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2020-02-08-acid-in-databases-concept/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="ACID concept"><meta property="og:description" content="I really like how Martin Kleppmann described ACID in his book, hence a little excerpt to remember.
