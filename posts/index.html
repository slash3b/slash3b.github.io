What it lacks is the live example of how it is done. So I’m going to just short list here an example.
For this code intro I’m going to use PHP7.2. The only PHP class we have is this one below, and it is pretty much naive but is usefull for our example:...</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2018-08-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 2, 2018</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Mutation testing in PHP" href=https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2018-08-02-mutation-testing-in-php/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>Amazing GIT for seasoned developer.</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>At first, like so many others I didn’t use git to full extent, the tool belt of git add, git commit, git push, git pull allowed me to survive through the day.

I chose ‘0 = key does not expire’ option.
To view fingerprint for the newly created key use:

Today at work I was silly enough not to ask help from my colleagues, I’ve decided to deal with the problem myself and came up with a shitty solution.
During code review horrible hackery was revaled and I was taugh to live a simple life.
Lets consider the following - there are two tables:
SELECT * FROM docs | id | rev | content | |----|-----|---------------------------------------------------| | 1 | 1 | The earth is flat | | 2 | 1 | One hundred angels can dance on the head of a pin | SELECT * FROM docvalues | id | doc_id | property_id | value | |----|--------|-------------|--------| | 1 | 1 | 10 | First | | 2 | 1 | 10 | Second | | 3 | 1 | 8 | Third | | 4 | 2 | 10 | Fourth | | 5 | 2 | 9 | Fifth | | 6 | 2 | 10 | Sixth | And what we need is to select all docs with docvalues where property_id is 9, thus we intend to get NULL result for those who does not have corresponding record in the docvalues....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2017-09-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 4, 2017</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Discovery of an advanced JOIN clause in MySQL" href=https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2017-08-30-additional-criteria-in-the-join-clause/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>PHP yield tl;dr</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>If you would like to run some php code samples, your own machine is fine, but I would recomment you to use 3v4l.org as a way to execute the code with ~200 different PHP version.

Starting from PHP 5.6 version we can write it using a special “splat” operator = ... So the simplest example would be this:
function variadic(...$args) { return $args; } var_dump(variadic(1,2,3,4)); // and you get it in form of the array [1,2,3,4] In the earlier versions of PHP func_get_args() and func_num_args() were used in order to create variadic functions....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2017-07-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 30, 2017</span></footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to PHP variadic functions" href=https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2017-07-30-php-variadic-functions/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>Encoging tl;dr</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Well, this is my own version of TLDR for an amazing post by David C.
