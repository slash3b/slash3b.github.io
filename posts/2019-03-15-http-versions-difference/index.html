<meta name=keywords content><meta name=description content="Here is the differences between HTTP versions with comments in plain english.
HTTP 1.0 capabilities:


Request may consist of multiple newline separated header fields.


Response object is prefixed with a response status line.


Response object has its own set of newline separated header fields.


Response object is not limited to hypertext.
So basically since this version it is not hypertext but hypermedia protocol.


The connection between server and client is closed after every request.
One of the main drawbacks of this protocol version."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2019-03-15-http-versions-difference/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://slash3b.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://slash3b.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://slash3b.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://slash3b.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://slash3b.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://slash3b.github.io/posts/2019-03-15-http-versions-difference/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="HTTP versions difference"><meta property="og:description" content="Here is the differences between HTTP versions with comments in plain english.
