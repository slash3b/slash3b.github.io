<p>In wikipedia we may find the following explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense &ldquo;related&rdquo;.<br>
The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge.</p>

<p>GraphQL uses type system to describe underluing data we can work with and ensure helpful error reporting. As the client specify what data needed we do not have to stick with version mangement for GraphQL endpoint, in other words GraphQL endpoints are versionless. You can add new fields without worrying - existing clients will still receive data.</p>
<p>So finally it looks something like this(gif stolen from the <a href=http://graphql.org/>graphql.org</a>):

<p>Lets start!<br>
We are going to use Symfony the GraphQL recommended PHP package - <a href=https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php>webonyx/graphql-php</a>.</p>
<p>In order to implement the very simple &ldquo;Hello GraphQL&rdquo; example I have to start with creating a simple controller
