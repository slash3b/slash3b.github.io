Basically you do not inherit class directly but get it injected into the constructor or via setter method. For instance:</p><p>Typical inheritance:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>
class MusicalIntstrument
{
    ...
}

class Violin extends MusicalInstrument
{
    ...
}
</code></pre><p>In this case you inherit everything from parent class and there is nothing wrong with it if that is what you want. But PHP does not support multi-inheritance - you can not inherit from muptiple classes simultaneously and sometimes you do <strong>not</strong> want to inherit everything from parent class. That is when composition helps. For example:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>
class MusicalIntstrument
{
    ...
}

class Violin
{
    // typed properties will be available in PHP 7.4
    private MusicalInstrument $instrument;

    // we can go with constructor injection
    public function __construct($instrument)
    {
        $this-&gt;instrument = $instrument;
    }

    // or you can do setter injection whenever you need
    public function setInstrument($instrument)
    {
        $this-&gt;instrument = $instrument;
    }

}
