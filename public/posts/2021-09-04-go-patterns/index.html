In these examples individual components we use are a sequential code and we are composing their independent execution.\nChannels are a first-class values in go. It means we can pass a channel to a channel, or e.g. a function to a function.\nnil channel trick way to disable a case in select package main import ( \"fmt\" \"math/rand\" \"time\" ) func main() { rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()) a, b := make(chan string), make(chan string) go func() { a \u003c- \"A\" }() go func() { b \u003c- \"B\" }() // here, we randomly \"nullifying\" one of the channels, // effectively disabling `case` in `select` if 0 == rand.Intn(2) { a = nil } else { b = nil } select { case out := \u003c-a: fmt.Println(out) case out := \u003c-b: fmt.Println(out) } } Worker pool a pool of workers eager to process your data A pool of worker goroutines ready to process incoming channel. Example below uses unbuffered channel but it can use buffered as well if you need it.\npackage main import ( \"fmt\" ) func main() { in := make(chan int) out := make(chan int) for i := 0; i \u003c 5; i++ { go worker(i, in, out) } go func() { defer close(in) for i := 0; i \u003c 5; i++ { in \u003c- i } }() for i := 0; i \u003c 5; i++ { fmt.Printf(\"--\u003e reseived result %d from `out` channel \\n\", \u003c-out) } fmt.Println(\"END\") } func worker(id int, in \u003c-chan int, out chan\u003c- int) { for v := range in { result := v * 2 out \u003c- v fmt.Printf(\" \u003c-- worker #%d have sent value: %d \\n\", id, result) } fmt.Println(\"exiting worker #\", id) } Rate limiter simple rate limiter using a buffered channel wrap handler with a func that tries to add to channel and defers release. If lenght of buffered channel is 10 then when we have 10 ongoing requests will be pending\nrateLimiterMiddleware := func(f func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)) func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request) { limitingBuffer := make(chan struct{}, 10) return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { limitingBuffer \u003c- struct{}{} defer func() { \u003c-limitingBuffer }() f(w, r) } } Confinement safety operations with concurrent code Apart from well know way to work with concurrent code in Go, sync primitives and channels, there are other two: data confinement and data immutability.\nData immutability is a simple and yet powerfull techique. Every goroutine operates on its own copy of a data. This leads to easied data management and low cognitive load.\nData confinement makes data implicitly available only to one process/goroutine at a time. Data confinements comes in two flavors: ad-hoc and lexical.\nAd-hoc confinement is a convention between programmers and your code base on how data is used.\nIn some sense, generator pattern from above is a good example of data confinement. Generator can be used concurrently but only one goroutine can get generated value at a time.\nLexical confinement. Lexical confinement means usage of lexical scope to hide data we do not want to be used concurrently. Example:\nfunc example() \u003c-chan int { a := make(chan int) go func() { defer close(a) for i := 0; i \u003c 5; i++ { a \u003c- i } }() return a } Main benefit of a confinement is a reduced cognitive load and “better” simplicity of a program.\nError handling Or how to be a good lad and stop ignoring/hiding your errors In terms of concurrency sometimes it might be hard to understand how, when and who should handle an error.\nDo not skip/ignore/hide an error that happened inside your goroutine. Bind err with response/outcome and return them together, e.g. in a Result struct:\ntype Result struct { Error error Response *http.Response } This will allow you to take more intelligent decision about error at the layer where we actually process results.\nGoroutines Additional but very important notes and some bits of theory This is based on book “Concurrency in Go” Sheduler is a part of OS and it is responsible for resource allocation that needed to run tasks. Task might be a process, thread, or data flow. Scheduler is responsible for multitasking that makes possible to run multiple programs on a single CPU core.\nGoroutine is a function that is running concurrently. Technically, goroutine is a coroutine.\nCoroutines, and thus goroutines, are implicitly concurrent constructs, but concur‐ rency is not a property of a coroutine: something must host several coroutines simul‐ taneously and give each an opportunity to execute—otherwise, they wouldn’t be concurrent! Note that this does not imply that coroutines are implicitly parallel. It is certainly possible to have several coroutines executing sequentially to give the illusion of parallelism, and in fact this happens all the time in Go.\nGo’s mechanism for hosting goroutines is an implementation of what’s called an M:N scheduler, which means it maps M green threads to N OS threads. Goroutines are then scheduled onto the green threads. When we have more goroutines than green threads available, the scheduler handles the distribution of the goroutines across the available threads and ensures that when these goroutines become blocked, other goroutines can be run.\nGo follows a model of concurrency called the fork-join model. The word fork refers to the fact that at any point in the program, it can split off a child branch of execution to be run concurrently with its parent. The word join refers to the fact that at some point in the future, these concurrent branches of execution will join back together. Where the child rejoins the parent is called a join point\nSo the join point is the place where goroutines sync, and it is done with sync primitives available in golang.\nGo handles multiplexing goroutines onto OS threads for you. The algorithm it uses to do this is known as a work stealing strategy.\nGoroutines are not garbage collected\nSources:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDDwwePbDtw Concurrency in Go by Cox-Buday K. https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa15/classes/20-thread-safety/#strategy_1_confinement https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa15/ https://graphitemaster.github.io/fibers/ https://github.com/luk4z7/go-concurrency-guide ","wordCount":"1240","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-09-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-09-04T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://localhost:1313/posts/2021-09-04-go-patterns/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Random notes to myself","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://localhost:1313/archives/ title=archives><span>archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://localhost:1313/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Golang concurrency tricks and patterns</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-09-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 4, 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1240 words&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/slash3b/slash3b.github.io/content/posts/2021-09-04-go-patterns.markdown rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Concurrency is the composition of independently executing computations.</p><p>Goroutines are not threads, but it is not wrong to think about goroutines as threads.
