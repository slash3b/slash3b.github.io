<p>Today at work I was silly enough not to ask help from my colleagues, I&rsquo;ve decided to deal with the problem myself and came up with a shitty solution.<br>
During code review horrible hackery was revaled and I was taugh to live a simple life.</p>
<p>Lets consider the following - there are two tables:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM docs

| id | rev |                                           content |
|----|-----|---------------------------------------------------|
|  1 |   1 |                                 The earth is flat |
|  2 |   1 | One hundred angels can dance on the head of a pin |

SELECT * FROM docvalues

| id | doc_id | property_id |  value |
|----|--------|-------------|--------|
|  1 |      1 |          10 |  First |
|  2 |      1 |          10 | Second |
|  3 |      1 |           8 |  Third |
|  4 |      2 |          10 | Fourth |
|  5 |      2 |           9 |  Fifth |
|  6 |      2 |          10 |  Sixth |
</code></pre>
<p>And what we need is to select all docs with docvalues where <code>property_id</code> is 9, thus we intend to get NULL result for those who does not have corresponding record in the docvalues. Right?</p>
<p>So the first mumbling query is the trivial one:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT docs.id, property_id, value FROM docs
    LEFT JOIN docvalues ON docvalues.doc_id = docs.id
    WHERE docvalues.property_id = 9;

| id | property_id | value |
|----|-------------|-------|
|  2 |           9 | Fifth |
</code></pre>
<p>And it does not give us that NULL value for the document with id = 1!<br>
You see, in this case what we would actually need is to have that <code>property_id</code> written for the document with id = 1 and NULL value for the <code>value</code> field.</p>
<p>So there is actually a neat solution and it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT docs.id, property_id, value FROM docs
    LEFT JOIN docvalues 
        ON docvalues.doc_id = docs.id 
        AND docvalues.property_id = 9;

| id | property_id |  value |
|----|-------------|--------|
|  2 |           9 |  Fifth |
|  1 |      (null) | (null) |
</code></pre>
<p>Now we got what we wanted initially, just thanks to this amazing JOIN clause!</p>
