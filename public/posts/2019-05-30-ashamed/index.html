In the capital - Chishinau, on average you earn ~500 euros per month. That’s bearable but basically not enough. Not enough to feel yourself steady on your legs so to speak.\nOn the other side if you are an IT “specialist”, lets use this vague term, then you can earn from ~1k euros per month. Than’s a huge deal!\nThan is why so many people are “getting” into IT - pure survivial instincts - you want to make a decent living in Moldova, you have to go into IT. It is easy? I think yes. A lot of people shamelessy confirm that they got into IT because of money. And this happens not only in Moldova, the same situation is happening in Ucraine, Russia.\nAnd you know I do not blame those people, I guess that is totally okay. I’m myself a self-taught programmer and whilst I knew that IT pays off pretty well, I came into the industry because I really love programming. I really love it even when it is painful, event when I have to eat shit all day long and feel helpless and hopeless. I love it when I have to fight with team lead over nothing. I love it even though it gave me unhealable dark circles under my eyes.\nI always wanted to be a part of something big, something meaningful but I guess it is not quite possible here in Moldova, here is why.\nLots and lots of outsource legacy projects with horrible clients. With adequate client legacy is totaly fine, but most of the clients are cheap and not very clever. You are basically just a cheap code monkey, nobody cares to listen to you and agree that we need testing, documentation, proper deploy procedure and etc. Nobody gives a fuck. Seriously.\nYou have no time to write documentation, to maintain it, no time for testing. It is cheaper just to file a new bug in Jira and let the monkey fix it. You do not understand some piece of domain logic? Something is not clear and nobody seems to know what is happening in that procedure? Go and fucking reverse engeneer it up to the last bit! You hourly rate is so cheap, nobody cares about your suffering.\nMy god, what shit have I seen… Probably the most fucked up shit was an artisanal PHP project of 3m lines of code with lots of copy-paste and no info at all, not testing, not documentation, and variables in french and database with 900+ tables, literally!\nThat shit is hard, if I could I’d cry myself to sleep each night. Thanks to my wondefull wife for support.\nBut you know what is the worst? Probably not even a client that exploits you but your colleagues. Lots of them are here just for money.\nThey do not fucking care about being a good specialist, about making a difference, about growing professionally. They. Just. Do. Not. Give. A. Flying. Fuck.\nOh and the management! It is so fucking mediocre.\nIt is rare privilege to meet a good, organized, compassionate manager that knows her work. I think I know just one, others are just a fucking scam along with apologetic piece-of-shit monkey-for-hire coders that do not even think to evolve. My god, and if you work in one of the major moldavian companies, you probably can watch a lot of gut wretching corporate bullshit. I’ve seen a lot. I mean it.\nAnd where are good developers and managers? Mostly they all fuck off from this country, like everybody else.\nSo this rant seems to be very depressing, but I believe it reflects current state of reality.\nHonestly I feel ashemed to be a programmer in Moldova simply because I see no value in my work and that is very depressing.\n","wordCount":"656","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2019-05-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2019-05-30T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://localhost:1313/posts/2019-05-30-ashamed/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Random notes to myself","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://localhost:1313/archives/ title=archives><span>archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://localhost:1313/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Mixed feelings about being programmer in Moldova
