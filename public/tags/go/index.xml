      <description>This snippet of code got me off guard.
Having a somewhat decent experience with golang I could not explain what is it doing and it took me embarrassingly a lot of time to figure out a sound explanation for what was going on.
After I figured out the answer, I think that my sleep deprivation just played tricks on me. Still let&amp;rsquo;s dig into this.
