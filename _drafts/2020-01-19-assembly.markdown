Assembly programm usually divided into sections.

Each section has its use, e.g.
`.text` holds instructions
`.data` is for global variables
**labels** are just readable names and addresses  
_star label is the **entry point** and it should be declared global with
`global _start`   
Assembly language consists of commands, which are directly mapped into machine code


write a value into either register or memory

Each system call has a unique number. To perform it
1. The rax register has to hold system callâ€™s number;
2. The following registers should hold its arguments: rdi, rsi, rdx, r10, r8, and r9.
System call cannot accept more than six arguments.
3. Execute syscall instruction




labels are justddO
