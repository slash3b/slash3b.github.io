Chapter 4. Modules should be deep.   
Modular desing allows a programmer to face a portion of design complexity of the system. Author distinguish two types of
modules with shallow and deep design. Shallow desing provide lots of method to work with, it gives us "bloated"
interface that hide not so much functionality. On the other side well designed deep modules effectively hide complexity
and provide a lot of benefin using slim interface.
There is a brillian example of file I/O provided by UNIX operating system that gives us 4 simple but yet very powerfull
system call to work with.
