title: "Ode to Psalm PHP"
---

At first I was introduced to Psalm by Marco Pivetta in one of his talks. I was curious but didn't have time to co
The next time Marco showed me Psalm in a video call I was blown away and did not understand some of the annotations, but the possibilities seemed to be endless.

What is Psalm?
Note that those types are not checked in a runtime which is awesome.:w
