For this new year I plan to:
 - find a better job where I will be appreciated as a professional
 Current job sucks, it boils down to this â€” I want to paint pictures and I hope one day to be able to create a masterpiece, but I'm forced to paint fences with guys who are totally happy to paint fences till the rest of their lives
 - be better at algorithmic problems, I'm better now, but still suck. Medium difficulty assignments on HackerRank are almost inpenetrable for me
 - learn C and learn it well, and then eigher Golang or Rust, dunno for now
 - learn multithreading programming, multithreading models
 - learn more about distributes systems and system design
 - do more open-source! Seems like one of the best ways to learn


Last year notes:
 - improved design patterns knowledge
 - going slowly throught [the daily plan](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university#the-daily-plan) and improved data structures knowledge
 - learned python and created pet project pirata.md  
 - improved linux fu
 - became better as PHP dev
 - read a bunch of books on php, ssh, ddd, REST API
 - grew up as programmer, but not as much as I'd wanted to : ) To be honest I have no growth at my full-time job which is really really bad.
 - had a second job for almost half a year, glad it nuked itself 
 - did some open-source contribution
 - math, I also need to improve my math!
